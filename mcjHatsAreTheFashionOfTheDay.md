# mcjHatsAreTheFashionOfTheDay
This mcjHatsAreTheFashionOfTheDay version is a clone of [mcjHatsAreTheFashionOfTheDay v.4 2019-02-20]( https://sites.google.com/site/mcasualsdazscripts9/mcjhatsarethefashionoftheday) which simplifies the usage of the original script. The installation of [mcjCollider](https://sites.google.com/site/mcasualsdazscripts2/mcjcolliderds45) is required to use this script.

Usage:
- Make sure that the character is not parented to anything.
- Select the hair of the character and start the script. (For the 1st launch any other part or object parented to the character will also work.)
  - A plane "plane_Hat_CharacterName" will be created and the script exits. Parent it to the hat and adjust the height and orientation as needed.
- Select the hair of the character and start the script again.
- Click the "Make Hair Morph" button.
- More information about the possible settings can be found on [mcjHatsAreTheFashionOfTheDay]( https://sites.google.com/site/mcasualsdazscripts9/mcjhatsarethefashionoftheday).
