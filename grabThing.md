# grabThing Beta
grabThing is still in a beta state. It is partly useable while it still has a lot of issues.

Usage: [grabThing Help](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godly/daz3d-scripts/master/content/documentation/godly/grabThing.html).

### Installation
Extract or copy the contents of the 'content' folder to the [DAZ Studio](https://www.daz3d.com/) library / content folder.
In a default installation this should be: '**C:\Users\\%USERNAME\%\Documents\DAZ 3D\Studio\My Library**'.
The resulting directory folder structure should be '**C:\Users\\%USERNAME\%\Documents\DAZ 3D\Studio\My Library\scripts\godly\**'
The scripts will be found in **My Library / Scripts / godly / grabThing**

### Removal
As long as no other scripts were installed in the scripts/godly simply delete the godly folder.
